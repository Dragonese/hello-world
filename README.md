# hello-world

Hello, I'm a student in Karelia University of Applied Sciences. I have none prior coding experience, but I do have a dream of one day having a game released and maintained by me (and my possible team). I live in the border of Joensuu and Liperi. I have soon 4 years old daughter, and me and my girlfriend are getting married next year. I am youth and leisure worker + undergraduate by my prior studies. 

I came to these studies as my prior studies weren't my piece of cake. Instead of searching work on my career path, I chose to follow my dreams.
